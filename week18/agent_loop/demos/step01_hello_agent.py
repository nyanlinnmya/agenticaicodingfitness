"""PART 1–2 · Your very first agent loop  [BEGINNER]

The smallest real agent: give Claude a goal and a couple of tools, then let the
loop run until the goal is met. Without the loop, a model answers once and
stops. With it, Claude can list files, read them, and keep going on its own.

Watch the output: you will see SESSION → ACT → OBSERVE → … → RESULT. Each ACT is
one *turn*; the loop decides by itself when it is done.

Run:  python demos/step01_hello_agent.py
