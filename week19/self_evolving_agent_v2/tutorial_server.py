"""Interactive, explainable tutorial for **Self-Evolving Agent v2 — sovereign on a DGX**.

The Week 18 self-evolving agent, with a switchable brain (local DGX model ↔ Claude
↔ sim) and its tripartite memory living on the DGX. Read the CONCEPT, view the
SOURCE, RUN each step, and watch the agent get smarter — all on your hardware.

        "1) The SWITCHABLE BRAIN. The same agent + memory can think with a local "
        "model on the DGX, with Claude in the cloud, or with a scripted stub — flip "
        "BRAIN=local|claude|sim. The memory engine never changes. It also makes the "
        "sovereignty cost explicit: only BRAIN=local keeps prompts on the box.\n\n"
        "2) SOVEREIGN MEMORY. A cloud agent's memory lives in a vendor's database. "
        "Here the agent's tripartite memory is files on the DGX:\n"
        "   • Episodic   → .memory/episodes.jsonl  (raw log of what happened)\n"
        "   • Semantic   → .memory/MEMORY.md       (consolidated durable facts)\n"
        "   • Procedural → .memory/skills/         (reusable skills it writes itself)\n"
        "Your agent's accumulated decisions — often your most sensitive asset — never "
        "leave the building.\n\n"
        "Run Ch 2–7 in order: log episodes → consolidate → inspect the self-written "
        "skill → prove it evolved (cold vs warm) → audit sovereignty. With no model "
