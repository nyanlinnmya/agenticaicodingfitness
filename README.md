# 🏋️‍♂️ Agentic Coding Fitness @ Rust Tech Bar

Welcome to the repository for the **Agentic Coding Fitness** event series, hosted weekly at Rust Bar, Ban Tad Thong! 

This repository contains all the code, tools, and examples built during our hands-on "Vibe Coding" sessions. It serves as a living codebase demonstrating how to transition from basic AI API calls to building sophisticated, multi-agent systems and real-world IoT integrations.

**Event Details**: [Luma Event Page](https://lu.ma/jy6d10xq)
- **When**: Every Tuesday, 18:00 – 20:00
- **Where**: Rust Bar, Ban Tad Thong (Bangkok)

## 🤖 What is Agentic Coding Fitness?
Think of this as a "fitness center" for your coding brain—but instead of lifting weights, we are building AI muscle muscle memory. We focus on **Agentic AI**: moving beyond simple prompt-and-response mechanisms to build AI that can think, plan, decide, and collaborate using multi-agent systems.

We emphasize a **practice-first** approach (Vibe Coding). No long lectures, just shipping workable solutions that interact with the real world!

## 📚 Catching up? Install the Bootcamp Plugin

Missed a session or want to review at your own pace? We packaged the **entire course (weeks 2–17)** into a shareable **Claude Code plugin** — **18 bite-sized skills** (one per concept) that teach the idea, show runnable code (pointing at the real `weekN/` files here), and walk you through a hands-on **$0 lab** (a tiny `MockLLM` so you need no API key to start). Just ask Claude in plain English and the right skill loads automatically.

**Install** (run these in any Claude Code session):

```
/plugin marketplace add kwarodom/agenticaicodingfitness
/plugin install agentic-coding-fitness@agentic-coding-fitness
```

Then try: *"Recap the whole course and tell me which skill to start with."*

### 🔄 Already installed? Pull the latest version mid-session

We ship new skills as the course grows (we're on **v2.1.0 — 18 skills**). To grab the newest version **without restarting**, run these three in your current session:

```
/plugin marketplace update agentic-coding-fitness                 # 1. refresh the catalog from GitHub
/plugin install agentic-coding-fitness@agentic-coding-fitness     # 2. fetch the latest version
/reload-plugins                                                   # 3. activate the new skills now
```

> There's no separate `/plugin update` command — **reinstalling** pulls the latest version from the refreshed marketplace. Step 1's argument is the *marketplace name* (`agentic-coding-fitness`), not the GitHub repo.

**Prefer clicking?** Run `/plugin` for the interactive manager: **Marketplaces** tab → select *agentic-coding-fitness* → **Update**, then **Installed** tab → select the plugin → **Reinstall**, then `/reload-plugins`. (You can also toggle **Enable auto-update** on the marketplace so new versions are fetched at startup.)
